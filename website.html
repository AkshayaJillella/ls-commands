   <h1>BULGOGI</h1><a href="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/bulgogi-korean-bbq-beef/"><img src="bulgoggiii.jpg" alt=""height="300px"width="300px">     <img src="bulgogi.jpg" alt=""height="300px"width="300px"></a>
   <p>Bulgogi (불고기), also known as Korean BBQ beef, is marinated thinly sliced beef, typically cooked over an open flame. “Bul” means fire in Korean, and “gogi” is a general term for meat. While there are other variations such as chicken and pork, the term generally refers to beef bulgogi.While Korean beef BBQ is most commonly char grilled at restaurants, there are many regional variations as to how this dish is prepared and served. In this bulgogi recipe, I’m also introducing Seoul-style bulgogi (서울식 불고기), which is how I used to eat bulgogi growing up. It’s also known as yetnal bulgogi (옛날불고기), meaning old-style or from the past. It’s a particular way the marinated meat is served up. Over the last decade or so, it has made a remarkable comeback and become very popular throughout the country. My family loves it!</p><hr><br>
   <h1>KIMBAP</h1><a href="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/gimbapkimbap-korean-dried-seaweed-rolls/"><img src="gimbap.jpg" alt=""height="300px"width="300px">  <img src="gimbappp.jpg" alt=""height="300px"width="300px"></a>
   <p>Kimbap (or gimbap, 김밥) is a Korean seaweed rice roll filled with a variety of delicious fillings. Gim (김) is a dried seaweed, and bap is rice. With various fillings, these rice rolls have an interesting combination of textures and flavors. We all grew up on these rice rolls. Our school field trips, outdoor activities, and family road trips wouldn’t have been complete without them! Today, kimbap is the most popular grab-and-go meal in Korea. You can practically find it everywhere with so many variations.</p><hr><br>
   <h1>DONKATSU</h1><a href="https://mykoreankitchen.com/donkatsu/"><img src="korean food.jpg" alt=""height="300px"width="300px"> <img src="donkatsuuuu.jpg" alt=""height="300px"width="300px"></a>
   <p>Donkatsu, also known as Donkkaseu (돈까스), is often recognized as the Korean take on the popular Japanese dish, Tonkatsu. The name “ton” comes from pork, while “katsu” is derived from “cutlet.” The pork cutlet is coated in panko bread crumbs for a crispy texture and deep-fried to achieve a golden-brown exterior. Interestingly, Japanese Tonkatsu is said to be inspired by the French dish, côtelette de veau. – I thought Schnizel was the one.</p><hr><br>

It all started in the 1960’s by Samyang Ramyun Company, the only ramyun brand we grew up on. There are now so many varieties and flavors of instant noodles by many competitors with growing global popularity. It’s a convenient and cheap comfort food.

    According to the news media, exports of South Korean instant noodles increased nearly 30 percent in 2020 to a record high to $606 million. Apparently, people have been eating more instant noodles during the lockdown. Also, the global popularity of “Jjapaguri” from the movie Parasite made significant contributions to the increase.</p><hr><br>

Dakgangjeong (닭강정) is a deep-fried crispy chicken dish glazed in a sticky, sweet, and spicy sauce. This recipe uses bite sized boneless chicken pieces, so it cooks up very fast in shallow oil. It’s the easiest Korean fried chicken you can make at home!

    Whenever I go to Korea, I try to enjoy as much Korean fried chicken as possible. There are so many delicious variations! Dakgangjeong is a big part of the Korean fried chicken culture, and some of the best dakgangjeong places are in traditional markets and streets of Korea, sometimes with long lines.</p><hr><br>
