   <h2>BULGOGI</h2><a href="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/bulgogi-korean-bbq-beef/"><img src="bulgoggiii.jpg" alt=""height="300px"width="300px"><img src="bulgogi.jpg" alt=""height="300px"width="300px"></a><hr><br>
   <p>Bulgogi (불고기), also known as Korean BBQ beef, is marinated thinly sliced beef, typically cooked over an open flame. “Bul” means fire in Korean, and “gogi” is a general term for meat. While there are other variations such as chicken and pork, the term generally refers to beef bulgogi.While Korean beef BBQ is most commonly char grilled at restaurants, there are many regional variations as to how this dish is prepared and served. In this bulgogi recipe, I’m also introducing Seoul-style bulgogi (서울식 불고기), which is how I used to eat bulgogi growing up. It’s also known as yetnal bulgogi (옛날불고기), meaning old-style or from the past. It’s a particular way the marinated meat is served up. Over the last decade or so, it has made a remarkable comeback and become very popular throughout the country. My family loves it!</p><hr><br>

   <p>Kimbap (or gimbap, 김밥) is a Korean seaweed rice roll filled with a variety of delicious fillings. Gim (김) is a dried seaweed, and bap is rice. With various fillings, these rice rolls have an interesting combination of textures and flavors. We all grew up on these rice rolls. Our school field trips, outdoor activities, and family road trips wouldn’t have been complete without them! Today, kimbap is the most popular grab-and-go meal in Korea.

   <h2>DONKATSU</h2><a href="https://mykoreankitchen.com/donkatsu/"><img src="korean food.jpg" alt=""height="300px"width="300px"> <img src="donkatsuuuu.jpg" alt=""height="300px"width="300px"></a>
   <p>Donkatsu, also known as Donkkaseu (돈까스), is often recognized as the Korean take on the popular Japanese dish, Tonkatsu. The name “ton” comes from pork, while “katsu” is derived from “cutlet.” The pork cutlet is coated in panko bread crumbs for a crispy texture and deep-fried to achieve a golden-brown exterior. Interestingly, Japanese Tonkatsu is said to be inspired by the French dish, côtelette de veau. – I thought Schnizel was the one.</p><hr><br>
